- **Note**: Some bugs may be system-level and unavoidable

### 3. Widget Handling ❌ PENDING
- **Challenge**: Widgets cannot be backed up/restored
- **Solution Needed**: 
  - Placeholder system for widgets in backups
  - User guidance to re-add widgets
  - Widget picker implementation

### 4. Notification Badges ⚠️ PARTIAL
- **Challenge**: Multiple badge styles with real-time updates
- **Status**: Basic count badges work
- **Needed**: 
  - NotificationListenerService enhancement
  - Badge style selection
  - Dynamic badge image loading

### 5. Prime Features & Licensing ❌ PENDING
- **Challenge**: Implement unlocker model
- **Solution Needed**:
